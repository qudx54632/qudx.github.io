## About Me

I am a faculty member in the College of Physics at Chengdu University of Technology. My research focuses on Loop Quantum Gravity, black hole physics, and the development of numerical methods in gravitational theory. I am particularly interested in exploring quantum gravitational effects in cosmology and black hole interiors, using both analytical and computational approaches.
