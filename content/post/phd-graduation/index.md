Iâ€™m overjoyed to share a major milestone in my life â€” I have successfully defended my PhD and received a postdoctoral offer from **Perimeter Institute**.

This journey has been long, challenging, and incredibly rewarding. Iâ€™m sincerely grateful to my advisor, **Dr. Muxin Han**, for his guidance and support throughout my PhD. His help in shaping a valuable research direction played a crucial role in the completion of my degree.

I am equally thankful to my collaborator **Dr. Hongguang Liu**, who guided me from the very first step of my research. His mentorship allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the subject, and I am grateful for the opportunities and insights he shared.

Special thanks go to **You Ding**, who encouraged me when I was lost at a young age. Without her guidance, I wouldnâ€™t have come to the US and pursued a career as a physicist.

Iâ€™m also grateful to my friends and colleagues **Le Fu**, **Xueting Zhang**, **De Ao**, **Qianru Chen**, **Dr. Hadi Gorak**, and many others for their time, advice, and encouragement.

I owe everything to my parents, whose unconditional love kept me motivated and strong. Their belief in me made all this possible. And to my older brother, thank you for always keeping me grounded.

Finally, I want to share the joy of another milestone â€” in **June 2022**, I married **Peng Wang**, my partner of 11 years. His unconditional support and love have been throughout this entire journey.

ðŸ’– To everyone who helped me become who I am â€” thank you. Hereâ€™s to the future.
