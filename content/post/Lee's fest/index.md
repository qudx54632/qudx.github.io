This event not only honored a pioneering figure in theoretical physics but also reflected on two decades of progress in foundational research.

It also marked a personal transition: I officially concluded my time at the **Perimeter Institute**. My years at PI have been formative, both professionally and personally. It was here that I learned to recognize what truly matters â€” in science and beyond. The environment at PI helped shape my character and sharpen my sense of direction.

Iâ€™m especially thankful to **Bianca Dittrich**, my mentor during this period, for helping me understand the importance of setting boundaries and maintaining clarity in professional interactions. Her strong work ethic and principled approach to research have had a lasting influence on how I engage with collaboration, make decisions, and grow as an academic.

Thank you to everyone at PI who supported me along the way â€” for the conversations, the challenges, and the shared pursuit of ideas that matter.
