abstract: We study shock wave formation in quantum-corrected gravitational collapse using a Loop Quantum Gravity-inspired model. By formulating the dynamics in generalized Painlevé–Gullstrand coordinates, we simulate how quantum effects replace classical singularities with weak discontinuities. Our results reveal novel horizon structures, shock behaviors, and curvature jumps that illuminate black hole formation near the Planck scale.
