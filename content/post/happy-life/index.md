I’m thrilled to share a personal milestone — in **June 2022**, I married **Peng Wang**, my partner of **11 years**.

Our journey together has spanned cities, time zones, and even countries — navigating long-distance through studies, research, and life transitions. From youthful days to academic paths, we supported each other through joys and challenges.

Getting married marked the beginning of a new chapter, not just as individuals, but as true partners — sharing everyday life, ambitions, laughter, and moments of vulnerability.

❤️ I'm deeply grateful for the companionship, patience, and love we’ve built over the years — and excited for all the adventures that lie ahead.

Here's to building a life where we celebrate the good days, support each other through the hard ones, and keep growing together.

Thank you to our family, friends, and mentors who’ve been part of our story.
