Iâ€™m delighted to share that I have officially joined **Chengdu University of Technology (CDUT)** as an **Assistant Professor of Physics**.

Starting this fall, I will be teaching **Quantum Field Theory I** for graduate students. The course will provide a strong theoretical foundation, equipping students with tools for both academic research and applied areas in high-energy physics.

Beyond teaching, I plan to continue my research in **covariant loop quantum gravity, quantum cosmology**, and **numerical methods in quantum gravity**. I will also be preparing new **research proposals and funding applications**, which, while challenging, offer opportunities to expand collaborative projects and build a research group.

As I begin supervising graduate students, Iâ€™m mindful of the balance between deep theoretical training and practical career development. Graduate education in physics requires both rigor and adaptabilityâ€”especially given the increasingly competitive academic and industrial landscape.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™ll share updates about upcoming lectures, student projects, and new research directions in quantum gravity as they unfold.

Thank you to my mentors, collaborators, and friends who supported me on this journey. Looking forward to this next chapter at CDUT!
